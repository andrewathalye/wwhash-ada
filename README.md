## wwhash-ada
These tools are not yet ready for use, but they are theoretically functional and available here for anyone adventurous enough to try them.

## wwbrute, wwdict, wwgen
wwbrute will brute force a given FNV32 hash using as many threads as you configure.
wwdict will attempt a dictionary attack on an FNV32 hash using a specified dictionary.
wwgen simply calculates an FNV32 hash based upon strings provided


## TODO
I'd love to make a complete Ada equivalent to wwiser, but that will take some time
